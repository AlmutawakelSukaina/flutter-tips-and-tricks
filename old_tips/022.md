"Program to interfaces, not implementations" is a very important concept in software design.

It is used to decouple your code from implementation-specific details.

A good use case for this is when creating repositories that connect to external data sources:

---


Once you have an interface (abstract class), you can *implement* it with a concrete implementation.

You can even create a "fake", which can be very useful in your tests.


---


During app startup, you can initialize your repository with a *concrete* instance (using a service locator or any other dependency injection system).

And the rest of your app can just access the repository using the base abstract class.

---


What are the benefits?

- You can swap your real repository with a completely different implementation - the rest of your code doesn't change at all
- You can mock the repository in your tests, so that they run faster and more reliably
