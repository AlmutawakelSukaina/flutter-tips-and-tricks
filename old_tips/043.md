Ever needed to create a *reactive* in-memory store for simple values?

To help with that, I created a simple wrapper class around BehaviorSubject (from the RxDart package).

Here's a (short) thread explaining how to use it. ðŸ§µ

In this example, we have a "fake" cart repository with async calls for reading and writing data.

This is useful when you don't have a backend (yet), but need something that the rest of the app can use.

As a bonus, it's easy to simulate delays, errors, etc.

---

Once you have this, the rest of the app can use the new Future and Stream-based APIs in the repository.

And later on, you can swap the "fake" repository for a real one (or even keep both for testing/production).

This is covered in more detail here:

Aside from BehaviorSubject, the RxDart package has many useful APIs for manipulating and combining streams.

You can learn more about it here:

Hope you found this useful.

Happy coding!


```dart

/// An in-memory store backed by BehaviorSubject that can be used to
/// store the data for all the fake repositories in the app.
class InMemoryStore<T> {
  InMemoryStore(T initial) : _subject = BehaviorSubject<T>.seeded(initial);
  // The BehaviorSubject that holds the data
  final BehaviorSubject<T> _subject;
  // The output stream that can be used to listen to the data
  Stream<T> get stream => _subject.stream;

  // A synchronous getter for the current value
  T get value => _subject.value;
  // A setter for updating the data
  set value(T value) {
    _subject.add(value);
  }

  void close() => _subject.close();
}


class FakeCartRepository {
  final _cart = InMemoryStore<Cart>(const Cart());

  Future<Cart> fetchCart() async {
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2));
    return Future.value(_cart.value);
  }

  Stream<Cart> watchCart() => _cart.stream;

  Future<void> setCart(Cart cart) async {
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2));
    _cart.value = cart;
  }

  void dispose() => _cart.close();
}
```
