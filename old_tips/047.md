Why should we write automated tests?

Here are a few reasons. 

Why write automated tests?
- Ensure app works as intended
- Catch bugs early (when they are cheaper to fix)
- Avoid regressions when making changes
- Help write better code in the first place
- Refactor with confidence
- Save you a lot of time (compared to manual tests)
