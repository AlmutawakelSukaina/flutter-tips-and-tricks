Did you know?

Starting from Dart 2.17, you can pass arguments to the superclass with a new shorthand syntax. ðŸ‘‡

Works with both named and positional arguments. 

```dart

class Person {
  Person(this.name);
  final String name;
}

// New way: Dart 2.17 onwards
class Employee extends Person {
  Employee(super.name, this.salary);
  final int salary;
}

// Old way: Before Dart 2.17
class Employee extends Person {
  Employee(String name, this.salary) 
    : super(name);
  final int salary;
}
```
