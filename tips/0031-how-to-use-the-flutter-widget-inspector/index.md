# How to use the Flutter Widget Inspector

Need to quickly become familiar with a new codebase?

The Widget Inspector is a great tool for that!

It lets you select widgets on your running app, and see:

- where they live in the widget tree
- where they are declared in your code

keeping everything in sync. 👌
