# Using `serverTimestamp()` in Firestore

Sometimes it's useful add a timestamp to documents in Firestore, so they can be ordered later.

For that, prefer using `serverTimestamp()`.

This always uses the UTC time standard, and is more reliable that using `DateTime.now()` on the client.

In your serialization code, you can then use `Timestamp.toDate()` and `Timestamp.fromDate()` to get the corresponding `DateTime`.

Note that two snapshots will be emitted:
- immediately with a null timestamp
- again with a non-null timestamp once the document is written to the server
