# Creating an empty Flutter project

Want to create an "empty" Flutter project without all the counter app boilerplate code?

Then simply pass a "-e" flag on the command line. Example:

```
flutter create -e test_app
```

This will generate minimal `pubspec.yaml` and `main.dart` files (without any comments). 👇
