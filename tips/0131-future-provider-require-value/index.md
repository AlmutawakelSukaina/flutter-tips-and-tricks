# Async Dependency Initialization with `requireValue` (Riverpod)

How do you initialize an async dependency during app startup, and use it *synchronously* afterwards?

With Riverpod, this is done in 3 simple steps:

1. Declare it inside a `FutureProvider`
2. Initialize it inside `main()`
3. Use `requireValue` afterwards

The key steps are to:

- declare and initialize the dependency inside a FutureProvider
- access the dependency with `requireValue` whenever needed (inside other providers or widgets)

But `requireValue` will throw unless there is a value already.

To address this, we can create a `ProviderContainer` inside `main()` and await until the `FutureProvider` is initialized.

As a result, any providers or widgets that depend (directly or indirectly) on the original FutureProvider only contain synchronous code.

So no `await` or `.when` is needed.

I used to solve this problem by:

- throwing an `UnimplementedError` inside the `FutureProvider`
- initializing the dependency with a provider override inside `main()`

But this approach much nicer and easier to follow. üôÇ

Happy coding!
