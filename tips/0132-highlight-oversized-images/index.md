# Highlight oversized images with the Flutter DevTools

Did you know?

The Flutter DevTools has an option to highlight images that are too large (this is a big problem if your app has many images, especially on mobile).

Once enabled, all oversized images will appear flipped and with inverted colors, so you can resize them as needed.

If desired, you can achieve the same effect by setting this flag inside your `main()`:

```dart
debugInvertOversizedImages = true;
```
