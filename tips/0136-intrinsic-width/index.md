# Use `IntrinsicWidth`, not fixed width

Ever tried to force multiple `Text` widgets to have the same fixed width (e.g. with a parent `SizedBox`)?

Don‚Äôt do that, as this will break your layout when the text size changes.

Instead, use `IntrinsicWidth` and let Flutter calculate the right size for you. üëç
