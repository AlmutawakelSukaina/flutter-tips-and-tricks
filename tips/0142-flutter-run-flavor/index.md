# Launching your Flutter app with flavors

Did you know?

When you run your Flutter app, you can add a `--flavor` argument.

To get the flavor at runtime, read the `FLUTTER_APP_FLAVOR` environment variable.

This will return a string that you can map to a type-safe enum.

Note that some platform-specific configuration is needed:

- on iOS and macOS, you need to set up some custom schemes and bundle IDs
- on Android, you need to add some `productFlavors` to the build.gradle file

Check this guide for all the details:
