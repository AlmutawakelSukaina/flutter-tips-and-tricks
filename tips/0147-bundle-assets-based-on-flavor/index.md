# How to bundle assets based on flavor

Did you know?

If you have assets that are only used in a specific flavor in your app, you can *conditionally* bundle them using the "path" and "flavors" options in your pubspec.yaml file.

This prevents your app bundle size from being bloated by unused assets.
