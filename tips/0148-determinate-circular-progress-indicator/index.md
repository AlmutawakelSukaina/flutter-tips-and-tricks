# Determinate Circular Progress Indicator

Did you know?

`CircularProgressIndicator` has two modes: "indeterminate" and "determinate".

To use the determinate mode, set a value in the [0, 1] range and customize the style as needed.

Then, control the value with `AnimatedBuilder` to create an animated countdown timer. ✨
